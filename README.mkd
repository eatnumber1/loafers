Shoes is a client side SOCKS library.

Currently, only SOCKSv5 CONNECT with no authentication is supported, but a
complete, standards compliant implementation is planned.

To use libshoes, a shoes_conn_t structure must be created and initialized. The
shoes_conn_t structure provides connection and state information to the
handshake routines such as hostname and port.

For the moment, the reader is referred to include/shoes.h for the available
routines.
